description: About Me
            I am an experienced Data Analyst with a strong background in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive product improvement and business success. My expertise spans SQL, Big Query, Python, and advanced visualization tools like Tableau. I thrive in analyzing user behaviour and building dashboards to track feature rollouts and marketing performance.

            Over the years, I have honed my skills in working with both structured and unstructured data, utilizing tools such as MongoDB, Google Analytics, and CleverTap. I am passionate about leveraging data to create impactful solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and driving data-driven decisions.

            I am expanding my technical capabilities by learning machine learning algorithms to further my contribution to advanced analytics and predictive modelling. 

            My portfolio showcases a selection of my projects, reflecting my dedication to delivering high-quality, data-driven insights.
